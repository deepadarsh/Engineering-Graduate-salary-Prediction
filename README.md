## Introduction
In this project, we aim to predict the salaries of engineering graduates based on various features such as educational background, skills, and GPA. The dataset used for this project is sourced from the "Engineering Graduate Salary Prediction" dataset.

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the code:
- Python (version 3.x)
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost


## Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps include importing the dataset, dropping unnecessary columns, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables. The code for data preprocessing can be found in the Jupyter Notebook .

## Data Visualization
Exploratory data analysis and visualization are performed to gain insights into the dataset. Visualizations include scatter plots, count plots, box plots, and heatmaps. The code for data visualization can be found in the Jupyter Notebook .

## Model Training
The XGBoost algorithm is used to train the prediction model. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and a standard scaler is applied to normalize the features. The code for model training can be found in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Results
The trained model is evaluated using the R2 score metric. The difference between the predicted and actual salaries is visualized using a distribution plot. The results and evaluation metrics are discussed in the Jupyter Notebook .

Please refer to the Jupyter Notebook for detailed code and explanations.
